        /// The ideal goal for filesystem file change monitoring that a client might have is to have
        /// a path to a file, whether the file exists or not, and request change notifications for
        /// that path object. The change notifications would be of the sort, "The file came into
        /// existence", "the file was deleted", "the file's contents changed", "the file's metadata
        /// changed," and the like - this is not an exhaustive list.
        ///
        /// Part of the problem is that sometimes it is impossible for the user's security context
        /// to even answer whether the file exists or not. Perhaps the user has access to the
        /// container (directory) in which the file resides, but not the file itself. Perhaps that
        /// is evidence that the file exists but may or may not allow for change monitoring. But
        /// perhaps the user's security context does not even grant permission to probe the
        /// container.
        ///
        /// On normal file operations, the semantics are trivial and immediate. The operation on the
        /// file fail and the failure is reported in the form of some hopefully relevant error code
        /// or exception.
        ///
        /// But in the case of a background file monitor, what is to be done?
        ///
        /// We will come back to this issue in a moment.
        ///
        /// Ignoring the security points, let us consider just the cases of where parts of the
        /// filesystem namespace come and go. If the entire container is missing when the watch is
        /// registered, presumably the desire of the client is to be notified if/when the container
        /// is created and then the file within comes into existence.
        ///
        /// In practicality these two paths can be unified - the container has to be accessed in
        /// order to observe the file within, and if the container cannot be accessed, the client is
        /// notified with the error information about the failure and the client can then make a
        /// decision about how to proceed. It can decide to cancel the watch, or it can request that
